# Pallet Town
A tool for making Pokemon TCG decks and exporting them to Tabletop Simulator

Original author: Brent Pappas

## Update: February 2022
As of February 2022, I will no longer be maintaining Pallet Town.
If any programmers out there would like to revive it, please feel free.

Here is a summary of the tools I used to build Pallet Town.
- Git/GitHub: For version control.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the site's front-end.
- NodeJS: For the site's back-end. See the package.json file for all the required packages.
- MongoDB: For the user and deck database.
- Heroku: For site hosting.
- Amazon AWS: For storing all the user-generated card images.
- [The Pokemon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/): For individual card scans.
